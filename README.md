# Word Frequency Counter

A Word Frequency Counter implementation made for CS187 class in UMass, using the programming language Java.

This counter utilizes array hashtables as a data structure in order to find and count the words using algorithms such as linear, quadratic, and second hash searching. Linear, quadratic, and double hash probing algorithms are used to place new words not found in the already existing hashtable.
